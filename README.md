# Portfolio
3 Neural Network based little projects on time series inference and image classification:
1. rally:    a silly trading algorithm (Conv NN + LSTM) to predict future (10 seconds ahead) price level of Bitcoin (time series inference)
2. immaga:   a convolutional neural network model (just a single ResNet-34 implementation) for image class recognition (image classification)
3. tempora:  a recurrent neural network model (ensemble of 5 GRU) for weather variables prediction (time series inference)
